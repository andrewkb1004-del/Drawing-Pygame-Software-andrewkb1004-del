## Description
# 1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.
It will give the user control of different drawing tools used to make an artistic piece.  This will give the artist
a chance to create their own simplistic style of art with the listed tools and features displayed.

## Features
- Pen tool
	- Makes the user artist draw on the pygame window canvas by using their mouse or tablet to click and drag along 
  the screen. (There will be an option to change the tip size.)

- Eraser tool
	- It will simply erase whatever pen tool or shape marks is on the screen by clicking on the sidebar and dragging
  the mouse. (There will be an option to change the tip size.)
  
- Shape tool 
	- Create rectangular, triangle, and circle shapes by clicking on the sidebar and dragging the mouse to any size.

- Color Wheel or Bar 
	- It will change the color of the pen tool and shape tool. If it can't be a wheel, then it can be a set of color
  scrolling controls. (There will be an option to change the opacity.)

- Layer Bar
	- A sidebar where the artist can switch between different layers of drawing, as well as add and delete them.

- Save and Open Key
	- A keyword function that allows the artist to save/export what they've drawn, and import the file when they want
  to continue working on it. (It will allow the artist to name the file and its extension.)

## Challenges
- How do I create buttons on image displays or functions that can be activated by a mouse button click.
- How do I make separate layers of different drawing displays.
- How do I open file explorer to navigate where to save file, and what extensions can it to import and export.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I'm strongly hoping that the software will be able to draw and erase art among all other functions. Changing the 
color of the pen and shape tool is my second most important outcome I'm hoping to meet.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Creating separate layers that overlap each other, and exporting/importing a file will require a lot of research.
Despite the challenge, it is useful for enhancing the production of art and give artist the chance to make continuous
progress with their work. If this outcome doesn't succeed, then the software itself becomes invaluable.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Creating a pygame window with a blank white background and button displays set along the sides.
  2. Adding the option to draw a base color using the pen tool, and an eraser tool that whitens over the art.

- Week 2
  1. Creating 3 button functions on the left sidebar displaying a rectangle, circle, and triangle to make the shape 
  tool feature.
  2. Creating the color wheel or bar to switch between colors with different hues, saturations, brightness, & opacity.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Create a right sidebar function to select layers to draw in, as well as adding and deleting them when needed.
  2. Creating the save key function to export the image into different extensions like a png, jpeg, and pygame file
  to import it back into the program if possible.
