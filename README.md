# Drawing Pygame Software
For this repository, I'm going to be making a drawing software in pygame where you can draw using a pen tool, shape tools (squares, circles, and triangle), and an eraser tool.  There will be options for changing its color, opacity, and adding new layers.  The software will also include a save key to save the drawing into a folder as an image file.
