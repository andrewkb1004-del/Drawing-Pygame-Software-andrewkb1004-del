## Description
For this project, I built my own drawing software or painting program in pygame.  In the coded software, an artist can draw using various tools like pen, eraser, and shapes.  They can change it's pen and fill color through a set of pallettes on the bottom, as well as an alpha and line width changing feature.

Artists can add new layers to 10 max, and delete them to 1 min.  To preserve the layers, the save key can open a dialog box where a tiff file can be exported.  To open it back up, the load key can import any project file, including tiff, to retrieve its drawn layers.  But it will overwrite the unsaved progress the artist was drawing previously.  And the import and export keys are used for saving the image of a currently selected layer.

The files and folders I included in this repository are the requirements text file to list the 3rd Party Libraries needed for this project; the proposal and README markdown files;  A src folder to contain the project file and its asset folder, which contains the png buttons displayed in the pygame window.
